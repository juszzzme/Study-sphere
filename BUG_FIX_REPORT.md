   - Safari may have issues with WebRTC features

## 8. Testing Instructions

### Prerequisites:
1. Node.js v14+ installed
2. MongoDB instance running locally or connection string configured
3. All dependencies installed (`npm install`)

### Running Tests:
1. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   cd Backend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In a new terminal, run the test suite:

   cd Backend
   npm test
   ```

3. For end-to-end testing, open the application in a web browser and manually verify:
   - Chat functionality
   - Calendar operations
   - Real-time updates

## 9. Deployment Notes

   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_secure_jwt_secret
   FRONTEND_URL=your_frontend_url
   ```

2. Recommended production setup:
   - Use PM2 or similar process manager
   - Enable HTTPS with valid certificates
   - Set up proper logging and monitoring

## 10. Future Improvements
